Test on a monochrome display; see if everything works. Particularly when
someone hits the ctrl-L (redraw everything) command.

X selections don't work. There's some code in there, but not so much with
the functional. 

Implement macros.

Configuration support for Unix?

Drag-scrolling.

Option to turn scrollbars off, or move to left.

Pasting can move the insertion mark below the bottom of the window.

Pasting too much causes it to take "a few tries to get to the bottom"?

In Makefile, no INCLUDEDIR breaks. ("-I" with no suffix.)

Make sure message line clears after get-fileref-by-prompt. 

In an indexed color environment (such as 8 bit-per-pixel), XGlk can
run out of colors. Then things start appearing as black, or otherwise
screwy.

Transparency in images doesn't work at all. Neither does gamma. 

Scaled images on dithered displays are dithered and then scaled, which
is a stupid order.

Closing text doesn't page, because there's no focus. Give focus.
(Same bug in MacGlk.)

When more text is outputted than fits the screen, it pauses, but
doesn't let you scroll up while paused until you scroll all the way
down first.  

Also, pressing space during line input in the latest xglk moves the
point over pictures and into the scrollbar area.

When there is more than one line of input with _s in it, the _s on
upperlines are overwritten by lower lines.

"I tried using the Kill button provided by my window manager to stop
the program (nitfol), and nothing happened.  I'm using WindowMaker, if
that helps."

Command switch for how to allocate colors -- and make the default
different if no images are compiled in.

Flushing (select_poll()) doesn't work? Do we need to flush the X
queue as well?
